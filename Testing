Mutation test: 
Fault-based Testing: directed towards “typical” faults that could occur in a program
• Basic idea: – Take a program and test data generated for that program
– Create a number of similar programs (mutants), each differing from the original in one small way, i.e., each
 possessing a fault • e.g., replace addition operator by multiplication operator
– The original test data are then run through the mutants
– If test data detect all differences in mutants, then the mutants are said to bedead, and the test set isadequate
