Divide & Conquer vs DP: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13538459/difference-between-divide-and-conquer-algo-and-dynamic-programming

Examples of Divide & Conquer:
SEARCHING ALGORITHM:
1.Binary Search
SORTING ALGORITHMS:
1. MergeSort
2. QuickSort

Examples of Dynamic Programming:
1. BellmanFord Algorithm for Single Source Shortest Path Calculation(It gives path from single source to all the other nodes)
2. Floyd Warshall Algorithm for All Pair Shorted Path Calculation(It gives path from all nodes to all other nodes)

Examples of Greedy:
1. Dijkstra's algorithm for Single Source Shortest Path Calculation(It gives path from single source to a single destination node)
2. Prim's Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree
3. Kruskal's Algorithm to find Minimum Spanning Tree
(Difference between Prims and Kruskals Algorithm: http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-in-Kruskals-and-Prims-algorithm)
Q: Given the differences, how is Kruskal's algorithm considered as a greedy approach ?
Ans: In Kruskal's algorithm, we sort all the edges in the graph and iteratively choose minimum edge during each iteration
to check whether it can be added to the MST (doesn't form cycle).
Thus, once an edge is selected and added in the MST, no further changes are made during the remaining other iterations.
If you compare this with Bellman-Ford algorithm for Shortest Path, during each iteration we get the shortest path, and during 
other remaining iterations we check to see if there are any shortest paths that can replace the previously calculated
shortest path. Thus, here we are modifying the previous results and taking into consideration the results of all iterations,
that is the shortest paths from all the nodes (since no of iterations = (no of nodes in graph) - 1).

This, is the reason why Bellman Ford is Dynamic and Kruskal's is Greedy
