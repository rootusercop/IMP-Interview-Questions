final - keyword
finally - block
finalize - method

final:
	final is a keyword. The variable decleared as final should be
	initialized only once and cannot be changed. Java classes
	declared as final cannot be extended. Methods declared as final
	cannot be overridden.
	
finally:
	finally is a block. The finally block always executes when the
	try block exits. This ensures that the finally block is executed
	even if an unexpected exception occurs. But finally is useful for
	more than just exception handling - it allows the programmer to
	avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return,
	continue, or break. Putting cleanup code in a finally block is
	always a good practice, even when no exceptions are anticipated.
	
finalize:
	finalize is a method. Before an object is garbage collected, the
	runtime system calls its finalize() method. You can write system
	resources release code in finalize() method before getting garbage
	collected.
