Model -> Also called as "the brain". This contains the bussiness logic. This layer also interacts with the
Data-Access layer (also called as database) for retrieving User Query results(the different user queries are 
provided by the Controller which interacts with User Input)
View -> This is the front end(User Interface) or the part of the application visible to the user. Many views can be created
for different users according to their priority and access levels
Controller -> The Controller is responsible for handling user inputs. This is the part which takes input from
the user and provides to the Model which gives query results to View so that the query results are visible
to the user.

We can say that one of the COMMON flow in MVC architecture or design patttern is:
Controller(take inputs from user) -> Model (communicate with database or data-access layer to provide query
result) -> View (show the query results to the user)
